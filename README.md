# Patient-Treatment-in-Emergency-Department
Business information system's exam

This project contains an in-depth analysis of the patient treatment process within an Emergency Department (ED) using Process Mining techniques. The objective is to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and deviations from the ideal workflow, linking patients' initial clinical characteristics with process performance.

# Key Objectives
Identification of performance bottlenecks, analysis of clinical variants and process model discovery: Reconstruct the actual process model (using the Inductive Miner) and evaluate its Conformance against real event logs.

# Repository Structure
exam.ipynb: Contains all Process Mining code, from data cleaning (pre-processing) to performance analysis, process model discovery (Petri Net), and clinical variant analysis.

dataset_for_exam.csv: (Not included, reference only) Event log used for the analysis.

README.md: This file.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)
- pm4py (Process Mining Framework)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
